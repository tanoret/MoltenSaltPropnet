"Data column definitions

(Salt) -- Formula of salt or salt mixture
(Composition range) -- Range of compositions for which the data applies
(Data type) -- A string indicating the type of data in the row
(T min) -- Lower end of temperature range in Kelvin
(T max) -- Upper end of temperature range in Kelvin; may not be present if the data applies to a single temperature.
(Uncertainty) -- Uncertainty (+/-) where available.
(Data 1) -- Interpretation of this column depends on the (Data type) value. See explaination below.
(Data 2) -- Interpretation of this column depends on the (Data type) value. See explaination below.
(Data 3) -- Interpretation of this column depends on the (Data type) value. See explanation below.
(Data 4) -- Intepretation of this column depends on the (Data type) value. See explanation below.
(Data 5) -- Intepretation of this column depends on the (Data type) value. See explanation below.
(Comment) -- Optional comment text regarding the data; may supply uncertainty information
(Formatting comment) -- Optional comment text disclosing a likely error in the data which was discovered when the data were reformatted.


The contents of the (Data 1) through (Data 5) columns depend on the data type:


Data type DP:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) at T = (Data 2) (K)

        The (Data 3), (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.
        The (T max) and (T min) columns should be empty.


Data type +E:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) * exp((Data 2) / (R * T))

        T is temperature in Kelvin.
        R is the gas constant, 8.31441 J /(mol * K).
        The (Data 3), (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.


Data type E1:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) * exp(((Data 2) / (R * T)) + ((Data 3) / T^2))

        T is temperature in Kelvin.
        R is the gas constant, 8.31441 J /(mol * K).
        The (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.


Data type E2:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) =  (Data 1) * exp((Data 2) / (R * (T - (Data 3))))

        T is temperature in Kelvin.
        R is the gas constant, 8.31441 J /(mol * K).
        The (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.


Data type I1:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) =  (Data 1) + (Data 2) * C

        C is the mole percent composition of the component noted in the (Composition range) column. The number should be a percentage (max value = 100) not a fraction.
        The (Data 3), (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.
        The (T max) column should be empty.


Data type I2:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) + (Data 2) * C + (Data 3) * C^2

        C is the mole percent composition of the component noted in the (Composition range) column. The number should be a percentage (max value = 100) not a fraction.
        The (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.


Data type I3:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) + (Data 2) * C + (Data 3) * C^2 + (Data 4) * C^3

        C is the mole percent composition of the component noted in the (Composition range) column. The number should be a percentage (max value = 100) not a fraction.
        The (Data 5) column should be empty.
        The (T max) column should be empty.


Data type I4:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) + (Data 2) * C + (Data 3) * C^2 + (Data 4) * C^3 + (Data 5) * C^4

        C is the mole percent composition of the component noted in the (Composition range) column. The number should be a percentage (max value = 100) not a fraction.
        The (T max) column should be empty.


Data type P2:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) + (Data 2) * T + (Data 3) * T^2

        T is temperature in Kelvin.
        The (Data 4), and (Data 5) columns should be empty.


Data type P3:  viscosity, v (mN * s / m^2) = (Data 1) + (Data 2) * T + (Data 3) * T^2 + (Data 4) * T^3

        T is temperature in Kelvin.
        The (Data 5) column should be empty.
